# Bug Bounty Hunter — OpenCode Guide

This repo is a professional bug bounty hunting framework for OpenCode, covering HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and Immunefi.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# macOS
brew install go python3 node jq

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install golang python3 nodejs jq
```

You also need [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) installed.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bpnrockstar/UnifiedBugHunter.git
cd UnifiedBugHunter
chmod +x install_tools.sh && ./install_tools.sh   # scanning tools
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh --opencode    # skills + commands
```

The installer will:
1. Symlink domain skills to `.opencode/skills/`
2. Copy commands to `.opencode/commands/`
3. Optionally write MCP server config to `opencode.json`

### Verify Installation

```bash
cd UnifiedBugHunter
opencode
# Ask: "do you have bug bounty skills?"
# Should confirm skills are loaded
```

## Usage

### Invoking Commands

OpenCode doesn't have slash commands. Use natural language:

| Task | Say |
|------|-----|
| Run recon | "recon target.com" or "run recon on target.com" |
| Start hunting | "hunt target.com" or "start hunting target.com" |
| Validate finding | "validate this finding" or "run validation" |
| Write report | "write a report" or "generate report" |

Commands auto-invoke based on context.

### Quick Start

```bash
cd UnifiedBugHunter
opencode

# In OpenCode:
> recon target.com
> hunt target.com
> validate
> report
```

## MCP Integration (6 servers)

| Server | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `burp` | Burp Suite proxy — intercept and replay requests |
| `caido` | Caido proxy — alternative to Burp |
| `hackerone` | HackerOne public API — Hacktivity, program stats, policy |
| `bugcrowd` | Bugcrowd public API — Crowdstream, program info, public bounties |
| `intigriti` | Intigriti public API — research blog, XSS challenge search |
| `immunefi` | Immunefi public API — disclosed reports, program TVL/bounties/contracts |

OpenCode MCP servers are configured under the `mcp` key in your `opencode.json` (project-level) or `~/.config/opencode/config.json` (global).

> **Format note:** OpenCode uses `mcp` (not `mcpServers`), `command` is a single array merging the executable and its arguments, and environment variables go under `environment` (not `env`). Use `{env:VAR_NAME}` to reference shell environment variables.

**Burp Suite MCP:**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "burp": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["java", "-jar", "/path/to/mcp-proxy-all.jar", "--sse-url", "http://127.0.0.1:9876"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Caido MCP:**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "caido": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "@caido/mcp-server"],
      "enabled": true,
      "environment": {
        "CAIDO_API_KEY": "{env:CAIDO_API_KEY}",
        "CAIDO_URL": "{env:CAIDO_URL}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**HackerOne MCP** (run from the project root — path is relative):
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "hackerone": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python3", "mcp/hackerone-mcp/server.py"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Bugcrowd MCP:**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "bugcrowd": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python3", "mcp/bugcrowd-mcp/server.py"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Intigriti MCP:**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "intigriti": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python3", "mcp/intigriti-mcp/server.py"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Immunefi MCP:**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "immunefi": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python3", "mcp/immunefi-mcp/server.py"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

See `mcp/*/opencode-config.json` for ready-to-copy snippets.

## Memory Management

Hunt memory auto-rotates at 10MB. To manually rotate:
```bash
python3 -m tools.memory_gc --rotate
```

## API Keys

Same as Claude Code version. See main README.md for:
- Chaos API (subdomain discovery)
- Optional keys (VirusTotal, SecurityTrails, etc.)

## The Rules (Always Active)

```
 1. READ FULL SCOPE FIRST   — only test what the program says you can
 2. ONLY REAL BUGS          — "Can an attacker do this RIGHT NOW?" if no, stop
 3. KILL WEAK FINDINGS FAST — 30-second check saves hours of wasted reporting
 4. NEVER GO OUT OF SCOPE   — one wrong request can get you banned
 5. 5-MINUTE RULE           — no progress after 5 min? move to the next target
 6. VALIDATE BEFORE REPORT  — run validation before you spend 30 min writing
 7. IMPACT FIRST            — start with the bugs that have the worst consequences
```

## Differences from Claude Code

| Feature | Claude Code | OpenCode |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Commands | `/recon target.com` | "recon target.com" |
| Skills location | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.opencode/skills/` (in project) |
| Commands location | `~/.claude/commands/` | `.opencode/commands/` (in project) |
| Memory rotation | Auto (Stop hook) | Manual (`python3 -m tools.memory_gc --rotate`) |
| MCP config | `.claude/settings.json` | `opencode.json` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/config.json` (global) |

## Troubleshooting

### Skills not loading
1. Check symlinks: `ls -la .opencode/skills/`
2. Restart OpenCode in this project directory

### Commands not working
1. Check commands: `ls -la .opencode/commands/`
2. Make sure you're running OpenCode from the project root
3. Check OpenCode logs for errors

### MCP servers not connecting
1. Check `opencode.json` (or `~/.config/opencode/config.json`) syntax — ensure `mcp` key uses `command` array + `environment` (not `args`/`env`)
2. Verify Java is in your PATH: `java --version`
3. Test the proxy jar manually: `java -jar /path/to/mcp-proxy-all.jar --sse-url http://127.0.0.1:9876`
4. List servers and auth status: `opencode mcp list`

## Contributing
